==============

I'm honeslty not exactly sure how far I will get with this analysis. I mainly would like to understand how Maya Midzik (mmidzik on github) conducted her 
data preparation on ship detection to understand how I can better prepare data from my project on oil well detection. 
I am a friend of Maya's and knew of her project doing something similar. I have cloned her git repository on shipnet in this folder. The repository can be visited
here: https://github.com/mmidzik/shipsnet
